"#terrorinthehalls" 

"Terror in the Halls" is a python based text adventure game set in a haunted school. The player must navigate through the school to find a key to escape. However, teacher ghosts haunt the rooms and want to bring the player to detention. Most are nice and offer a question to test their intelligence. Other are not so nice.

Ready to navigate through these halls??
